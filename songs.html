                            Now, I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
                            That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
                            But you don't really care for music, do ya?<br>
                            It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth<br>
                            The minor fall, the major lift<br>
                            The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br><br>

                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br><br>

                            Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
                            You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
                            Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
                            She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
                            She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
                            And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br><br>

                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br><br>

                            You say I took the name in vain<br>
                            I don't even know the name<br>
                            But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?<br>
                            There's a blaze of light in every word<br>
                            It doesn't matter which you heard<br>
                            The holy or the broken Hallelujah<br><br>

                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br><br>

                            I did my best, it wasn't much<br>
                            I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch<br>
                            I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya<br>
                            And even though it all went wrong<br>
                            I'll stand before the Lord of Song<br>
                            With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah<br><br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>
                            Hallelujah Hallelujah<br>

                            You got a fast car<br>
                            And I want a ticket to anywhere<br>
                            Maybe we make a deal<br>
                            Maybe together we can get somewhere<br><br>

                            Any place is better<br>
                            Starting from zero, got nothing to lose<br>
                            Maybe we'll make something<br>
                            Me, myself, I got nothing to prove<br><br>

                            You got a fast car<br>
                            I got a plan to get us out of here<br>
                            I've been working at the convenience store<br>
                            Managed to save just a little bit of money<br><br>

                            Won't have to drive too far<br>
                            Just across the border and into the city<br>
                            You and I can both get jobs<br>
                            Finally, see what it means to be living<br><br>

                            See, my old man's got a problem<br>
                            He live with the bottle, that's the way it is<br>
                            He says his body's too old for working<br>
                            His body's too young to look like his<br><br>

                            Mama went off and left him<br>
                            She wanted more from life than he could give<br>
                            I said, "Somebody's got to take care of him"<br>
                            So, I quit school and that's what I did<br><br>

                            You got a fast car<br>
                            Is it fast enough so we can fly away?<br>
                            Still gotta make a decision<br>
                            Leave tonight, or live and die this way<br><br>

                            So, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car<br>
                            Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk<br>
                            City lights lay out before us<br>
                            And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder<br>
                            And I, I, I had a feeling that I belonged<br>
                            I, I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br><br>

                            You got a fast car<br>
                            We go cruising, entertain ourselves<br>
                            You still ain't got a job<br>
                            So I work in a market as a checkout girl<br><br>

                            I know things will get better<br>
                            You'll find work and I'll get promoted<br>
                            We'll move out of the shelter<br>
                            Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs<br><br>

                            So, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car<br>

                            I got a job that pays all our bills<br>
                            You stay out drinking late at the bar<br>
                            See more of your friends than you do of your kids<br><br>

                            I'd always hoped for better<br>
                            Thought maybe together you and me would find it<br>
                            I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere<br>
                            Take your fast car and keep on driving<br><br>

                            Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
                            I've come to talk with you again<br>
                            Because a vision softly creeping<br>
                            Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
                            And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
                            Still remains<br>
                            Within the sound of silence<br><br>

                            In restless dreams, I walked alone<br>
                            Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
                            'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
                            I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
                            When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
                            That split the night<br>
                            And touched the sound of silence<br><br>

                            And in the naked light, I saw<br>
                            Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
                            People talking without speaking<br>
                            People hearing without listening<br>
                            People writing songs that voices never shared<br>
                            And no one dared<br>
                            Disturb the sound of silence<br><br>

                            "Fools" said I, "You do not know<br>
                            Silence like a cancer grows<br>
                            Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
                            Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
                            But my words, like silent raindrops fell<br>
                            And echoed in the wells of silence<br><br>

                            And the people bowed and prayed<br>
                            To the neon god they made<br>
                            And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
                            In the words that it was forming<br>
                            Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
                            In tenement halls"<br>
                            And whispered in the sound of silence<br><br>

                            Rows and floes of angel hair<br>
                            And ice cream castles in the air<br>
                            And feather canyons everywhere<br>
                            Looked at clouds that way<br><br>

                            But now they only block the sun<br>
                            They rain and they snow on everyone<br>
                            So many things I would have done<br>
                            But clouds got in my way<br><br>

                            I've looked at clouds from both sides now<br>
                            From up and down and still somehow<br>
                            It's cloud illusions I recall<br>
                            I really don't know clouds at all<br><br>

                            Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels<br>
                            The dizzy dancing way that you feel<br>
                            As every fairy tale comes real<br>
                            I've looked at love that way<br><br>

                            But now it's just another show<br>
                            And you leave 'em laughing when you go<br>
                            And if you care, don't let them know<br>
                            Don't give yourself away<br><br>

                            I've looked at love from both sides now<br>
                            From give and take and still somehow<br>
                            It's love's illusions that I recall<br>
                            I really don't know love<br>
                            I really don't know love at all<br><br>

                            Tears and fears and feeling proud<br>
                            To say, "I love you, " right out loud<br>
                            Dreams and schemes and circus crowds<br>
                            I've looked at life that way<br><br>

                            Oh, but now old friends, they're acting strange<br>
                            And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed<br>
                            Well, something's lost, but something's gained<br>
                            In living every day<br><br>

                            I've looked at life from both sides now<br>
                            From win and lose and still somehow<br>
                            It's life's illusions I recall<br>
                            I really don't know life at all<br><br>

                            It's life's illusions that I recall<br>
                            I really don't know life<br>
                            I really don't know life at all<br><br>

                            Starry, starry night<br>
                            Paint your palette blue and gray<br>
                            Look out on a summer's day<br>
                            With eyes that know the darkness in my soul<br><br>

                            Shadows on the hills<br>
                            Sketch the trees and the daffodils<br>
                            Catch the breeze and the winter chills<br>
                            In colors on the snowy, linen land<br><br>

                            Now, I understand what you tried to say to me<br>
                            And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
                            And how you tried to set them free<br>
                            They would not listen, they did not know how<br>
                            Perhaps they'll listen now<br><br>

                            Starry, starry night<br>
                            Flaming flowers that brightly blaze<br>
                            Swirling clouds in violet haze<br>
                            Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue<br><br>

                            Colors changing hue<br>
                            Morning fields of amber grain<br>
                            Weathered faces lined in pain<br>
                            Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand<br><br>

                            Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me<br>
                            How you suffered for your sanity<br>
                            How you tried to set them free<br>
                            They would not listen, they did not know how<br>
                            Perhaps they'll listen now<br><br>

                            For they could not love you<br>
                            But still your love was true<br>
                            And when no hope was left inside<br>
                            On that starry, starry night<br><br>

                            You took your life as lovers often do<br>
                            But I could have told you, Vincent<br>
                            This world was never meant for one<br>
                            As beautiful as you<br><br>

                            Starry, starry night<br>
                            Portraits hung in empty halls<br>
                            Frameless heads on nameless walls<br>
                            With eyes that watch the world and can't forget<br><br>

                            Like the strangers that you've met<br>
                            The ragged men in ragged clothes<br>
                            The silver thorn of bloody rose<br>
                            Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow<br><br>

                            Now, I think I know what you tried to say to me<br>
                            How you suffered for your sanity<br>
                            How you tried to set them free<br>
                            They would not listen, they're not listening still<br>
                            Perhaps they never will<br><br>
